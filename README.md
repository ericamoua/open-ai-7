# About the Project:
The LRNR app is a quiz-based project that implements the OpenAI API to create questions based on various selections in a few categories. This project was built with various languages with Vite(React) for our front end and node and express for most of the back end. We picked these languages because of their speed and capabilities allowed for shorter wait time from filing out the quiz form to receiving the quiz. Some of the challenges we faced as a group with the project was making sure that when the Open AI API gave a question, it was able to understand not just one version of that answer but different variations. As a group in a later version, we are looking to expand to quiz selections to allow for more questions and hopefully implement other tools alongside quizzes.

## Technologies/languages used in the project:

React(Vite)
HTML
Materialize(css)
Node.JS
Express
Cors

# Setup/installation
	
	Install node.js
- Run git clone git@github.com:ericamoua/open-ai-7.git(or clone your own fork of the repository)
- Go into the cloned folder with cd open-ai-7

- Open a new terminal and go into the cloned folder with cd frontend
- Run npm install (This step needs to be done for both because they have different dependencies)
- Open a new terminal and go into the cloned folder with cd backend
- Run npm install (Do this for the backend as well.)
- Run node server.js
- Browse to http://localhost:8000



## Approach

	As a group from the beginning, our approach to the project was to focus on user experience and wait time. With those two ideas in our minds since the beginning, we focused heavily on overall responsiveness on many different screen sizes. Working on wait time was a big time and as a wait to approach this we researched ways to allow for quicker load times so by using Vite over creating a react app and by using things such as  async functions allowed for us to approach this project well.

Status(is the project done or still in  completion)

	As of right now the LNR app has been completed but we are looking to add to it
